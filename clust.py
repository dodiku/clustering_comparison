[ ] K-means, Hierarchical and Spectral techniques. In particular, Hierarchical and Spectral methods should be extensively compared.

[ ] The accuracy of each clustering model should be assessed via test set, for instance using the concentric noisy circles data presented during the lab class;

[ ] numerical study as to the impact of parameters in the quality of the clustering, mainly regarding spectral clustering, which demands several parameters.

[ ] Results should be presented as a report
